# Sam’s dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles. I created it from scratch. You are free to use it if you want.. But I recommend you create your own dotfiles.. It's a learning journey and It's fun! You can do exactly what you want or you can just take the inpiration for another dotfiles and make it in your own way.
